      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        "When Scars Become Art" is a deeply personal song by American artist Gatton, born out of a challenging period in his life. While attending college in Tennessee, Gatton experienced significant personal losses that led to feelings of grief and self-discovery. Seeking solace, he turned to music as a therapeutic outlet. In an interview, Gatton shared that he wrote the song during one of the hardest seasons of his life, aiming to create art from his pain. </p>
      <p>
       The song's title and lyrics encapsulate the idea of transforming personal pain into something beautiful and meaningful. Gatton emphasized that the song represents his attempt to cultivate art out of every scar, reflecting a universal endeavor to make sense of suffering.
