    <h2>How to play Tumbang Preso?    </h2>
    <p>One player or the tayà (the "It") guards the can. The objective is for the players to hit and knock down the can with the slipper, and for the tayà to put back the can inside a small circle a few meters away from the toe-line. When a player is tagged while recovering their slippers, they become the tayà.</p>
